# Wavelet-Neural-Network
WNN implementation for forecasting electricity consumption 
This project proposes a method for forecasting the monthly
electrical consumption is an attempt to optimize energy production
by predicting the electricity consumption based on the past data by
implementing the stochastic recurrent network. It implements DWT
which is used to extract information from the signal in combination
with Stochastic Recurrent Wavelet Neural Network (SRWNN)
where the information is fed to predict the consumptions based on
the past data signal.
